\title{Retrieve infrastructure polygon features around an area}
\usage{
get_infra_poly(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{sf} object used as the input area.}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object of type \code{POLYGON} containing infrastructure
features with standardized fields, including:
\itemize{
\item \code{TYPE} — Infrastructure type code:
\itemize{
\item \code{BAT} = Building
\item \code{CIM} = Cemetery
\item \code{CST} = Surface construction
\item \code{AER} = Aerodrome runway
\item \code{SPO} = Sports ground
\item \code{VIL} = Urbanized area (importance 1–2)
\item \code{HAB} = Residential area
}
\item \code{NAME} — Toponym when available
\item \code{SOURCE} — Data source (\code{IGNF_BDTOPO_V3})
}

\description{
Retrieve infrastructure polygon features around an area
}
\details{
The function retrieves several polygon infrastructure layers from
the IGN BDTOPO V3 dataset within a 1000 m convex buffer around \code{x}.

Retrieved layers include buildings, cemeteries, surface constructions,
aerodrome runways, sports grounds, and residential or urbanized areas.

If no infrastructure data are found, the function returns an empty
standardized \code{sf} object.
