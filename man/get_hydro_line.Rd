\title{Retrieve and assemble hydrographic lines around an area}
\usage{
get_hydro_line(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{sf} object used as the input area.}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object containing hydrographic line features with four fields:
\itemize{
\item \code{TYPE} — hydrographic class
\itemize{
\item \code{RUP} = Permanent hydrographic line
\item \code{RUI} = Intermittent hydrographic line
}
\item \code{NATURE} — Original BDTOPO nature field
\item \code{NAME} — Official hydrographic name (when available)
\item \code{OFFSET} — Offset information
}
}
\description{
Builds a convex buffer around the input geometry, retrieves hydrographic
line features from BDTOPO, normalizes them, and returns a combined \code{sf}
linestring layer.
}
\details{
The function retrieves BDTOPO hydrographic line segments
(\code{troncon_hydrographique}) within a 1000 m convex buffer around \code{x},
assigns the hydrographic types, normalizes the geometries,
and returns them as a single combined layer.
