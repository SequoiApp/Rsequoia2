\title{Retrieve and classify toponymic point features around an area}
\usage{
get_toponyme(x, verbose = verbose)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{sf} object defining the input area of interest.}

\item{verbose}{\code{logical} If \code{TRUE}, display messages.}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object containing toponymic point features with standardized
attribute fields:
\itemize{
\item \code{TYPE} — Toponym class
\itemize{
\item \code{HYD} = Hydrographic toponym
\item \code{VEG} = Vegetation-related toponym
\item \code{TYP} = Other toponyms
}
\item \code{NATURE} — Original BDTOPO object nature
\item \code{NAME} — Official toponym name (when available)
\item \code{SOURCE} — Data source identifier (\code{IGNF_BDTOPO_V3})
}
}
\description{
Builds a fetch_envelope buffer around the input geometry, retrieves toponymic
point features from the BDTOPO dataset, classifies them by thematic type
(hydrographic, vegetation, or other), normalizes the result, and returns
a standardized \code{sf} point layer.
}
\details{
The function creates a 1000 m fetch_envelope buffer around the input geometry \code{x}
and retrieves toponymic point features from the BDTOPO toponymy layer.
Retrieved features are classified into thematic types based on their
object class, attribute names are standardized, and geometries are
normalized before being returned as a single \code{sf} point layer.
