\title{Remove Overlaps in a \emph{PARCA} Layer}
\usage{
remove_overlaps(parca)
}
\arguments{
\item{parca}{An \code{sf} object, typically produced by \code{\link[=seq_parca]{seq_parca()}},
containing cadastral parcels.}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object corresponding to the input \code{parca} layer,
with overlaps resolved, geometries aggregated by \code{IDU}, and normalized.
}
\description{
This function resolves overlapping geometries in a \emph{PARCA} layer by keeping
a single geometry for each overlapping area, based on INSEE total surface.
It then aggregates geometries by \code{IDU} and normalizes the result.
}
\details{
\strong{Workflow:}
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Clean topology}: Fix minor topological issues using \code{clean_topology()}
with \code{snap} and \code{break}.
\item \strong{Detect overlaps}: Identify geometries that are duplicated due to overlaps.
\item \strong{Rank INSEE}: Compute total \code{SURF_CA} per INSEE and assign a rank,
so that INSEE with largest total surface has highest priority.
\item \strong{Select overlaps}: For each overlapping geometry, keep only the entity
with the highest INSEE rank.
\item \strong{Combine with non-overlaps}: Merge resolved overlaps with geometries
that do not overlap.
\item \strong{Aggregate by IDU}: Merge geometries with the same \code{IDU} and preserve
the first occurrence of non-numeric attributes.
\item \strong{Normalize}: Apply \code{seq_normalize()} to standardize the layer.
}

Temporary columns used internally (\code{geom_key}, \code{overlap_id}, \code{insee_rank})
are removed in the output.
