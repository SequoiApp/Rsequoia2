\usage{
get_parca(idu, bdp_geom = TRUE, lieu_dit = FALSE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{idu}{\code{character} Vector of IDU identifiers.}

\item{bdp_geom}{\code{logical} If \code{TRUE}, replace Etalab geometries with BDP when possible.}

\item{lieu_dit}{\code{logical} If \code{TRUE}, attach lieux-dits to each parcel.}

\item{verbose}{\code{logical} If \code{TRUE}, display progress messages.}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object of parcels with harmonized attributes.
}
\description{
Downloads parcel geometries from the Etalab cadastre API and optionally
replaces them with higher-quality BDP geometries when available.
Lieux-dits and administrative attributes (commune, département, région)
are joined automatically.
}
\details{
The BDP ("Base de Données Parcellaire") is an older IGN product that is no
longer updated. It was originally derived from Etalab cadastral parcels,
but the geometries were manually corrected by IGN to better match reality

Cadastral limits and the real terrain rarely match perfectly. Using BDP may
therefore improve spatial accuracy, but cannot guarantee exact
correspondence with legal cadastral boundaries.
