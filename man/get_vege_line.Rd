\title{Retrieve forest vegetation lines around an area}
\usage{
get_vege_line(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{sf} object used as the input area.}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object containing forest vegetation line features
with standardized fields, including:
\itemize{
\item \code{TYPE} — Vegetation type
\itemize{
\item \code{FOR} = Forest
}
\item \code{SOURCE} — Data source (\code{IGNF_MASQUE-FORET})
}
}
\description{
Retrieve forest vegetation lines around an area
}
\details{
The function derives forest vegetation linear features from
vegetation polygons obtained with \code{get_vege_poly()}.

Polygons are dissolved with a tolerance of 5 meters, converted
to linear geometries, and intersected with a 1499 m convex buffer
around \code{x}. Resulting geometries are cast to \code{LINESTRING} and
normalized.

If no vegetation polygons are available, the function returns
an empty standardized \code{sf} object.
