\description{
Retrieves road features intersecting and surrounding
the project area, classifies them by thematic type, and writes the
resulting layer to disk.
}
\details{
Road features are retrieved using \code{\link[=get_road]{get_road()}}.

If no road features are found, the function returns \code{NULL}
invisibly and no file is written.

When features are present, the layer is written to disk using
\code{\link[=seq_write]{seq_write()}} with the key \code{"v.road.topo.line"}.
