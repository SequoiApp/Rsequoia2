An \code{sf} object of type \code{POINT} containing vegetation point
features with standardized Sequoia fields, including:

\description{
Generate vegetation point features around an area
}
\details{
The function retrieves BD Foret V2 vegetation areas within a 1000 m convex
buffer around \code{x}. Each polygon is classified into a standardized vegetation
type based on its original \code{nature} attribute.

\code{TYPE}: Vegetation type code derived from BDTOPO nature values:
- \code{FEV}: Deciduous forest
- \code{REV}: Coniferous forest
- \code{FRV}: Coniferous and deciduous forest
- \code{PEV}: Poplar plantation
- \code{LAV}: Woody heath

Vegetation points are generated by spatial sampling using a hexagonal
pattern, with one point per 4 hectares of vegetation area.

If no vegetation areas are found, the function returns an empty
standardized \code{sf} object of type \code{POINT}.
