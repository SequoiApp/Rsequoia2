\title{Generate vegetation point features around an area}
\usage{
get_vege_point(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{sf} object used as the input area.}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object of type \code{POINT} containing vegetation point
features with standardized Sequoia fields, including:
\itemize{
\item \code{TYPE} — Vegetation type code derived from BDTOPO nature values:
\itemize{
\item \code{FFF} = Closed deciduous forest
\item \code{FFM} = Closed mixed forest
\item \code{FFC} = Closed coniferous forest
\item \code{FOI} = Open forest
\item \code{PEU} = Poplar plantation
\item \code{BOI} = Woodland
\item \code{LAN} = Woody heath
\item \code{HAI} = Hedge
\item \code{VER} = Orchard
\item \code{VEG} = Other vegetation types
}
\item \code{SOURCE} — Data source (\code{IGNF_BDTOPO_V3})
}
}
\description{
Generate vegetation point features around an area
}
\details{
The function retrieves BDTOPO vegetation areas (\code{zone_de_vegetation})
within a 1000 m convex buffer around \code{x}. Each polygon is classified
into a standardized vegetation type based on its original
\code{nature} attribute.

Vegetation polygons are then intersected with a 1500 m convex buffer,
cast to polygons, normalized, and filtered to exclude woody heath (\code{LAN})
and hedges (\code{HAI}).

Vegetation points are generated by spatial sampling using a hexagonal
pattern, with one point per 4 hectares of vegetation area. Sampled
points are spatially joined to vegetation attributes and clipped to
a 1499 m convex buffer.

If no vegetation areas are found, the function returns an empty
standardized \code{sf} object of type \code{POINT}.
