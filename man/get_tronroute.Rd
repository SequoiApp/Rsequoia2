\title{Retrieve road sections around an area}
\usage{
get_tronroute(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{sf} object used as the input area.}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object of type \code{LINESTRING} containing road sections
with standardized fields, including:
\itemize{
\item \code{TYPE} — Road section type code, deduced from surface, numbering
and importance attributes:
\itemize{
\item \code{RN} = National road (autoroutes, European roads, numbered roads
starting with \code{A}, \code{E}, \code{N}, or departmental roads numbered > 900,
as well as major slip roads)
\item \code{RD} = Departmental road (numbered roads starting with \code{D})
\item \code{RC} = Communal road (other paved roads)
\item \code{RF} = Forest or gravel road (unpaved / empierrée)
\item \code{PN} = Natural path (tracks, trails, footpaths)
}
\item \code{NATURE} — Original BDTOPO road nature (surface / usage description)
\item \code{NAME} — Road identifier, taken from \code{cpx_numero} when available,
otherwise from \code{cpx_toponyme_route_nommee}
\item \code{SOURCE} — Data source (\verb{BDTOPO V3})
}
}
\description{
Retrieve road sections around an area
}
\details{
The function retrieves road section layer from
the IGN BDTOPO V3 dataset within a 1000 m convex buffer around \code{x}.

If no road section data are found, the function returns an empty
standardized \code{sf} object.
