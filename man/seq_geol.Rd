\title{Create a geology layer for a Sequoia project from BRGM data}
\usage{
seq_geol(dirname = ".", cache = NULL, verbose = TRUE, overwrite = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dirname}{\code{character} Directory where the matrice file is located.
Defaults to the current working directory.}

\item{cache}{\code{character}; Storage directory. Defaults to the user cache
directory (see \code{\link[tools:userdir]{tools::R_user_dir()}}).}

\item{verbose}{\code{logical} If \code{TRUE}, display messages.}

\item{overwrite}{\code{logical} If \code{TRUE}, overwrite zipfile.}
}
\value{
An invisible \code{sf} object containing the merged geology layer.
}
\description{
Uses the \emph{PARCA} from Sequoia to determine which French departments are
involved, downloads the corresponding BRGM geology datasets, and
builds a single geology layer for the project.
}
\details{
Created layer and its \emph{QML style file} are automatically written to the
project directory using \code{\link[=seq_write]{seq_write()}}.

\strong{Difference between BRGM and CARHAB data}

The BRGM 1:50000 geological maps are detailed, heterogeneous products
created for geological interpretation. They include many finely split
geological units and may show inconsistencies between neighbouring map
sheets due to varying survey dates, methods, and levels of detail.

CARHAB data are a simplified, harmonised reinterpretation of these maps.
Geological formations are recoded into broader lithological classes tailored
for ecological modelling. The goal is to provide consistent, comparable,
and ecologically relevant information across departments.

In short: \strong{BRGM layers describe geology in detail; CARHAB layers provide a
simplified lithology better suited for habitat modelling.}
