# Generate vegetation point features around an area

Generate vegetation point features around an area

## Usage

``` r
get_vege_point(x)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  An `sf` object used as the input area.

## Value

An `sf` object of type `POINT` containing vegetation point features with
standardized Sequoia fields, including:

- `TYPE` — Vegetation type code derived from BDTOPO nature values:

  - `FFF` = Closed deciduous forest

  - `FFM` = Closed mixed forest

  - `FFC` = Closed coniferous forest

  - `FOI` = Open forest

  - `PEU` = Poplar plantation

  - `BOI` = Woodland

  - `LAN` = Woody heath

  - `HAI` = Hedge

  - `VER` = Orchard

  - `VEG` = Other vegetation types

- `SOURCE` — Data source (`IGNF_BDTOPO_V3`)

## Details

The function retrieves BDTOPO vegetation areas (`zone_de_vegetation`)
within a 1000 m convex buffer around `x`. Each polygon is classified
into a standardized vegetation type based on its original `nature`
attribute.

Vegetation polygons are then intersected with a 1500 m convex buffer,
cast to polygons, normalized, and filtered to exclude woody heath
(`LAN`) and hedges (`HAI`).

Vegetation points are generated by spatial sampling using a hexagonal
pattern, with one point per 4 hectares of vegetation area. Sampled
points are spatially joined to vegetation attributes and clipped to a
1499 m convex buffer.

If no vegetation areas are found, the function returns an empty
standardized `sf` object of type `POINT`.
