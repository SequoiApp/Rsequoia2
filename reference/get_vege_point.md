# Generate vegetation point features around an area

Generate vegetation point features around an area

## Usage

``` r
get_vege_point(x)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  An `sf` object used as the input area.

## Value

An `sf` object of type `POINT` containing vegetation point features with
standardized Sequoia fields, including:

## Details

The function retrieves BD Foret V2 vegetation areas within a 1000 m
convex buffer around `x`. Each polygon is classified into a standardized
vegetation type based on its original `nature` attribute.

`TYPE`: Vegetation type code derived from BDTOPO nature values: - `FEV`:
Deciduous forest - `REV`: Coniferous forest - `FRV`: Coniferous and
deciduous forest - `PEV`: Poplar plantation - `LAV`: Woody heath

Vegetation points are generated by spatial sampling using a hexagonal
pattern, with one point per 4 hectares of vegetation area.

If no vegetation areas are found, the function returns an empty
standardized `sf` object of type `POINT`.
